# Pocket Pet
*Pocket Pet* is a virtual pet simulator inspired by the classic digital pet, Tamagotchi. Take care of your adorable virtual companion by managing its stats and ensuring its well-being. The game is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Getting Started
To play *Pocket Pet* and start taking care of your virtual pet, you can play the game [here](https://jtnguyen45.github.io/pocket-pet/).

Once the page is loaded, the game has started! The goal of the game is to keep your pet happy and keep all of their stats above **zero**. You can interact with your pet with the buttons at the bottom of the screen to do the following:

- Pet them to increase happiness
- Feed them so they won't starve
- Have them go to sleep to recharge their energy
- Take a bath to keep them clean
- Play with them so they don't get bored

You win if your pet reaches level 5, and you lose if any of their stats reach zero. Do your best to take care of your pet.

You can start over at anytime by pressing the "RESET" button, and can even toggle the background music **on** and **off**. Have fun!

### Next Steps
These are some fun features that I would like to implement in the future:
- *Pet/Theme Selection:* Introduce the option for players to choose different pets or themes, such as Pompompurin or My Melody
- *Skill Development:* Implement a carousel feature for buttons that allow players to engage in activites to increase their pet's skill stats, such as fishing or cooking
- *Custom Action Buttons:* Enhance the action buttons to provide more customized interactions, where an action can affect multiple pet stats
- *In-Game Economy:* introduce a virtual currency system and a store where players can purchase items like food or toys for their pet
